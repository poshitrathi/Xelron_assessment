# Xelron AI Technical Assessment Submission

This repository contains my submission for the Xelron AI technical assessment. The assessment is divided into four parts, covering repository analysis, pull request comprehension, prompt engineering, and technical communication.

## 📂 Submission Structure

The submission is organized into the following four files:

* **[Part 1: Repository Analysis](./part1_repository_analysis.md)**
    * A comparative analysis of strictly Python-based repositories (`aiokafka`, `beets`, `MetaGPT`, `archivematica`), detailing their functionality, architecture, and dependencies.

* **[Part 2: Pull Request Analysis](./part2_pr_analysis.md)**
    * A deep-dive technical analysis of two specific Pull Requests from the `beets` repository:
        1.  **PR #3145:** Fix `import --flat` logic.
        2.  **PR #3279:** Fix path sanitization regression.

* **[Part 3: Prompt Preparation](./part3_prompt_preparation.md)**
    * A comprehensive prompt engineering document for **PR #3145**. This includes repository context, acceptance criteria, edge cases, and the initial prompt designed to guide an AI model in implementing the fix.

* **[Part 4: Technical Communication](./part4_technical_communication.md)**
    * A response to a hypothetical reviewer explaining the rationale behind selecting the "Flat Import" PR, demonstrating technical self-awareness and problem-solving skills.
